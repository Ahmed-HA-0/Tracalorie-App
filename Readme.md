# Tracalorie 🍽️

A simple yet effective calorie tracker built with **Vanilla JavaScript** and styled using **Bootstrap**. This app allows users to log meals, assign calorie values, and monitor their daily intake in a clear, responsive UI.

## 📌 About the Project

This project was built as part of my ongoing journey to deepen my front-end development skills. It focuses on JavaScript fundamentals like DOM manipulation, state management in the browser, and dynamic UI updates — all without using any frameworks or libraries.

**Key features:**

- Add and delete meals
- Track calories consumed and remaining
- Responsive Bootstrap layout
- Persistent data storage using `localStorage`
- Real-time updates to UI based on user actions

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3 / Bootstrap 5**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **LocalStorage** for persistence

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter a meal name and its calorie value.
2. The meal is added to the tracker and updates the calorie totals.
3. Meals can be removed individually or cleared entirely.
4. Data remains saved even after refreshing the browser.

## 💡 Why This Project

As a developer focused on mastering the fundamentals before diving deep into frameworks, this project was a great opportunity to:

- Practice clean DOM scripting without abstractions
- Learn state handling in vanilla JS
- Build a functional, user-friendly interface with Bootstrap
